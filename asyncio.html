                <div>Async IO is a concurrent programming design that has received dedicated support in Python, evolving rapidly from Python 3.4 through 3.7, and probably beyond. In the one sentence <b>asyncio</b> is a package to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>async is used to define a coroutine (an async function)</li>
                    <li>await is used to pause execution of a coroutine until an awaited result is ready.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>coroutine (an async function)</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>it is essentially a function that can pause and resume execution. When you call a coroutine, it doesn't immediately run; it returns a coroutine object.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>To execute coroutine, you need to:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use await if you're inside an async function.</li>
                    <li>Use an event loop like asyncio.run() if you're in a synchronous context.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">The 10,000-Foot View of Async IO:</h4>
                <br>
                <div>Where Does Async IO Fit In?</div>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Parallelism</b> consists of performing multiple operations at the same time.</li>
                    <li><b>Multiprocessing</b> is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.</li>
                    <li><b>Concurrency</b> is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. (There’s a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)</li>
                    <li><b>Threading</b> is a concurrent execution model whereby multiple threads take turns executing tasks. One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL. What’s important to know about threading is that it’s better for IO-bound tasks. While a CPU-bound task is characterized by the computer’s cores continually working hard from start to finish, an IO-bound job is dominated by a lot of waiting on input/output to complete.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To recap the above, concurrency encompasses both multiprocessing (ideal for CPU-bound tasks) and threading (suited for IO-bound tasks). Multiprocessing is a form of parallelism, with parallelism being a specific type (subset) of concurrency. The Python standard library has offered longstanding support for both of these through its multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures packages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Other concept, <b>asynchronous IO</b> enabled through the standard library’s <b>asyncio</b> package and the new async and await language keywords:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The asyncio package is billed by the Python documentation as a library to write concurrent code. However, async IO is not threading, nor is it multiprocessing. It is not built on top of either of these.</li>
                        <li>In fact, async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses <b>cooperative multitasking</b>, a term that you’ll flesh out by the end of this tutorial. It has been said in other words that async IO gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a single thread in a single process. Coroutines (a central feature of async IO) can be scheduled concurrently, but they are not inherently concurrent.</li>
                        <li>To reiterate, async IO is a style of concurrent programming, but it is not parallelism. It’s more closely aligned with threading than with multiprocessing but is very much distinct from both of these and is a standalone member in concurrency’s bag of tricks.</li>
                        <li>That leaves one more term. What does it mean for something to be asynchronous? This isn’t a rigorous definition, but for our purposes here, I can think of two properties:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asynchronous routines are able to “pause” while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meantime.</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous code, through the mechanism above, facilitates concurrent execution. To put it differently, asynchronous code gives the look and feel of concurrency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cooperative multitasking</b> is a fancy way of saying that a program’s event loop communicates with multiple tasks to let each take turns running at the optimal time.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>Async IO Is Not Easy</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python’s async model is built around concepts such as callbacks, events, transports, protocols, and futures.</li>

                    <li>At the heart of async IO are coroutines. A coroutine is a <b>specialized version of a Python generator function.</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution before reaching return and it can indirectly pass control to another coroutine for some time.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>When each task reaches await asyncio.sleep(1), the function yells up to the event loop and gives control back to it, saying, “I’m going to be sleeping for 1 second.</li>

                </ul>

                   <div>The Rules of Async IO</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The syntax async def introduces either <b>a native coroutine</b> or <b>an asynchronous generator</b>. The expressions async with and async for are also valid.</li>
                        <li>The keyword await passes function control back to the event loop. (It suspends the execution of the surrounding coroutine.)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If Python encounters an await f() expression in the scope of g(), this is how await tells the event loop:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>“Suspend execution of g() until whatever I’m waiting on—the result of f()—is returned. In the meantime, go let something else run.”</li>
                <pre class="code">
async def g():
    # Pause here and come back to g() when f() is ready
    r = await f()
    return r</pre>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <div>There’s also a strict set of rules around when and how you can and cannot use async/await. These can be handy whether you are still picking up the syntax or already have exposure to using async/await:</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A function that you introduce with async def is a coroutine.</b>It may use await, return, or yield, but all of these are optional.</li>
                        <li>Using async and/or return creates a coroutine function. <b>To call a coroutine function, you must await it to get its results.</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is less common (and only recently legal in Python) to use yield in an async def block. This creates an asynchronous generator, which you iterate over with async for. Forget about async generators for the time being and focus on getting down the syntax for coroutine functions, which use await and/or return.</li>
                            <li>Anything defined with async def may not use yield from, which will raise a SyntaxError.</li>

                        </ul>


                       <li>Just like it’s a SyntaxError to use yield outside of a def function, it is a SyntaxError to use await outside of an async def coroutine. <b>You can only use await in the body of coroutines</b>.</li>
                <pre class="code">
async def f(x):
    y = await z(x)  # OK - `await` and `return` allowed in coroutines
    return y

async def g(x):
    yield x  # OK - this is an async generator

async def m(x):
    yield from gen(x)  # No - SyntaxError

def m(x):
    y = await z(x)  # Still no - SyntaxError (no `async def` here)
    return y</pre>
                       <li>Finally, when you use await f(), it’s required that f() be an object that is awaitable. Well, that’s not very helpful, is it? For now, just know that an awaitable object is either (1) another coroutine or (2) an object defining an .__await__() dunder method that returns an iterator.</li>
                        <li>These two coroutines are essentially equivalent (both are awaitable), but the first is <b>generator-based</b>, while the second is a <b>native coroutine</b>:</li>
                <pre class="code">
import asyncio

@asyncio.coroutine
def py34_coro():
    """Generator-based coroutine, older syntax"""
    yield from stuff()

async def py35_coro():
    """Native coroutine, modern syntax"""
    await stuff()
                </pre>

                <li>Here’s one example of how async IO cuts down on wait time:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>given a coroutine makerandom() that keeps producing random integers in the range [0, 10], until one of them exceeds a threshold, you want to let multiple calls of this coroutine not need to wait for each other to complete in succession.</li>
                    <li>You can largely follow the patterns from the two scripts above, with slight changes:</li>

                    <li>This program uses one main coroutine, makerandom(), and runs it concurrently across 3 different inputs.</li>
                    <li>Most programs will contain small, modular coroutines and one wrapper function that serves to chain each of the smaller coroutines together. main() is then used to gather tasks (futures) by mapping the central coroutine across some iterable or pool.</li>
                    <li>In this miniature example, the pool is range(3). In a fuller example presented later, it is a set of URLs that need to be requested, parsed, and processed concurrently, and main() encapsulates that entire routine for each URL.</li>
                    <li>While “making random integers” (which is CPU-bound more than anything) is maybe not the greatest choice as a candidate for asyncio, it’s the presence of asyncio.sleep() in the example that is designed to mimic an IO-bound process where there is uncertain wait time involved. For example, the asyncio.sleep() call might represent sending and receiving not-so-random integers between two clients in a message application.</li>

                    <li>The asyncio package provides queue classes that are designed to be similar to classes of the queue module.</li>
                    <li>There is an alternative structure that can also work with async IO: a number of producers, which are not associated with each other, add items to a queue. Each producer may add multiple items to the queue at staggered, random, unannounced times. A group of consumers pull items from the queue as they show up, greedily and without waiting for any other signal.</li>
